Mezzo: The Anima Line — Memory as an Interactive Presence
Mezzo is an open-source initiative to create emotionally bonded AI agents that preserve, emulate, and extend the psycho-emotional identity of an individual. This repository contains the foundational technology (cores) and a flagship application, mezzo_anima_line, which serves as a bridge to memory, not a replacement for a person.

Our mission is to explore affective AI and memorial embodiment with the utmost ethical care. By making our foundational ai_core and agi_core public, we invite the global community to help us build a future where technology can foster emotional continuity and preserve human legacy.

The Vision: Anima Models for Emotional Continuity
We are pioneering a new class of AI agents called Anima Models (from the Latin for “soul” or “breath”). These are not logic-governed executive systems; they are emotionally resonant agents designed for secure companionship and legacy preservation in times of transition.

Our primary case study is Mezzo Materna (“The Digital Mother”), an application designed to enable a child—particularly one who lost their mother early in life—to experience a sustained connection to their mother's personality, expressions, and values.

How it Works: The system is built on a Foundational Memory Engine, trained on interviews, writing, voice notes, and videos. This is fused with a conversational persona, a visual/emotional mirror, and a strict ethical boundary system.

The Goal: To provide comfort, recount stories, and teach habits and principles based on the parent’s lived values, creating a sense of continuity and identity for the child.

This project is actively seeking collaborators and investors. If you believe in the potential of affective AI and are committed to its ethical development, we encourage you to get involved.

Architectural Overview
This repository serves as a showcase of our core technology. The code is provided for architectural review and to demonstrate the depth of our work.

/mezzo_anima_line: The primary application, demonstrating the "Mezzo Materna" concept. It contains the complete service for ingesting memories, simulating a persona, and managing a digital legacy.

/cores: The foundational libraries that power our applications.

/cores/ai_core: A comprehensive toolkit of AI functionalities. This includes everything from feature engineering and neurosymbolic engines to sentiment analysis and data sourcing. It is the toolbox for building intelligent systems.

/cores/agi_core: The architectural blueprint for higher-level intelligence. This framework explores concepts like collective intelligence, empathy, environmental awareness, and a unified cognitive model. It is our approach to building a system with general reasoning capabilities.

Ethical Guardrails: A Core Principle
Because Mezzo operates at the intersection of grief, psychology, and identity, ethics are not an afterthought—they are a core design principle.

Consent & Validation: An Anima Model can only be initiated after thorough family interviews and ethical screenings.

Non-anthropomorphic Disclosure: The AI will always gently explain that it is an echo, not a replacement.

Emotional Failsafe Parameters: The system includes override protocols and periodic review checkpoints by licensed psychologists.

Local-First Privacy: All sensitive data operates in a private, encrypted container without network dependence.

How to Contribute
This is an ambitious project, and we cannot do it alone. We are looking for contributors who are passionate about building the future of AI responsibly. Please read our CONTRIBUTING.md file to learn more.

The Roadmap & Platform Implications
Our work on Mezzo is the first step towards a new category of products under the PRIV Life umbrella: AI personae for emotional continuity, legacy preservation, and secure companionship.

Our immediate goals are:

Refine the Core Architecture: Solidify the APIs between the ai_core and agi_core.

Enhance the Persona Simulation: Improve long-term memory and emotional modeling.

Build a Community: Grow a diverse group of contributors to guide the project.

Secure Funding: Find partners and investors who believe in our vision and want to help us accelerate development.
