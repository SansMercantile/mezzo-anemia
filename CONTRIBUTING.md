Contributing to Mezzo Anima
First, thank you for your interest in contributing to Mezzo Anima. This project is a massive undertaking, blending deep technical challenges with profound ethical considerations. Every contribution, from a bug report to a high-level architectural discussion, is deeply valued.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing. These are not strict rules, but a guide to help us collaborate effectively.

Our Philosophy: An Open Core for an Ethical Future
Our development model is "Open Core."

The Cores (/cores) are Open Source: We believe the foundational technology for AGI must be developed transparently and collaboratively. We invite researchers, developers, and ethicists to help us build these components robustly and safely.

The Applications (/mezzo_anima_line) are a Showcase: Our flagship application serves as a powerful demonstration of what our cores can achieve. While the code is public for review, it is not a community-run open-source application in the traditional sense. It is the first product in a planned suite of proprietary applications.

Our primary goal at this stage is to attract visionary partners and investors who can help us realize the full potential of this technology.

How You Can Contribute
We welcome contributions in many forms:

Discussions & Ideas
The best way to start is by engaging with our vision. Open an issue on our GitHub Issues page to:

Discuss the ethical implications of Anima Models.

Propose new architectural ideas for the ai_core or agi_core.

Suggest features for future applications.

Ask questions about our roadmap and vision.

Bug Reports & Code Review
If you are reviewing the code and find a potential bug, a security vulnerability, or an architectural inconsistency, please open a detailed issue. Your expert eyes are invaluable.

Code Contributions
While our primary focus is on securing investment, we are open to high-impact code contributions to the foundational /cores.

If you wish to contribute code, please follow this process:

Open an Issue: Propose your change or feature in a new issue and discuss it with us first. This ensures that your work aligns with the project's direction.

Fork & Branch: Fork the repository and create a new branch from main for your work.

Develop: Write clean, well-documented code.

Submit a Pull Request: Open a pull request back to our main branch, linking it to the original issue.

We will review all pull requests, but please understand that as a small team focused on fundraising, our review process may take time.

Thank you again for your interest. We are excited to build a community of people who are as passionate about the future of ethical, emotionally resonant AI as we are.
